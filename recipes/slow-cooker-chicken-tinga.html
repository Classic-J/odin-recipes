        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This recipe is super hearty and full of flavor! It features tomato chipotle sauce and packs some smoky heat from some chipotle peppers. This is super versatile as I use it to eat on its own or with tortillas to make Chicken Tinga Tacos.

            This recipe is super quick and simple with the use of a slow cooker and can be done in a total of 1.5 hours including all prep. Once you taste this once you'll be swayed by the ease of making so much great food so quickly!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato purée</li>
                <li>2 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced, plus 1 tablespoon of the sauce</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper. Place in a single layer in a 4-quart or larger slow cooker.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, oregano, bay leaf, and the 1 teaspoon of salt, and stir to combine. Stir in the tomato purée, chipotle peppers, and adobo sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour the sauce and onions over the chicken. Cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through and tender, 2 to 3 hours on the LOW setting or 1 to 2 hours on the HIGH setting.</li>
                <li>Turn off the slow cooker and transfer chicken to a clean cutting board. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces with two forks. Return the chicken to the slow cooker and stir to coat with the sauce before serving in tortillas with toppings if desired.</li>
            </ol>
